# SimNetEDA

- Proposes SimNetEDA, a similarity network–based framework for disease–enhancer prediction
- Learns enhancer and disease representations using graph attention networks
- Avoids information leakage by decoupling representation learning from known associations
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness across multiple ablation studies
- Provides biological evidence via GWAS support and pathway enrichment analysis
